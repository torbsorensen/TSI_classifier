# TSI_classifier (in the making...)
A short guide on how to build a convolutional neural network to classify images from the Total Sky Imager on Summit Station, Greenland, in fogbow/icebow/nobow

## Introduction
This short guide is a result from a summer internship completed in 2021 at [SENSE - Centre for Satellite Data in Environmental Science](https://eo-cdt.org) at the University of Leeds under supervision from Dr Ryan R. Neely and Heather Guy. The overall goal of the project was to investigate Greenlandic fog, and we decided to use the large amount of photos from the Total Sky Imager to make a timeseries of when fog occured and whether it formed by liquid or frozen droplets.
